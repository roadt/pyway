<p><strong>What values are important to Clayton Utz? </strong></p>

<p>At Clayton Utz, our culture is based on Trust, Respect and Co-operation – the fundamental relationship values which we all rely on in our day-to-day lives and relationships with family, friends and, importantly, with colleagues.</p>

<p>Together with our foundation value of Highest Ethical Standards, these behavioural values and expectations form our Firm Charter, the platform from which we can all work towards achieving our mission – to be The Firm of Choice.</p>

<p><strong>What distinguishes Clayton Utz from other firms?</strong></p>

<p>People. It always starts with people. At Clayton Utz, we've built a team of down-to-earth, collaborative lawyers who know that at the heart of exceptional client service is knowing what your client needs. We offer the sharpest legal minds. The clearest advice that cuts through the complexity, so our clients can concentrate on the things that really matter. And an unshakeable sense of what’s possible.</p>

<p>This offers our graduates the opportunities to work on cutting-edge, complex transactions and litigation with lawyers who are recognised as leaders in their fields. We also provide first-class training and development to support our lawyers to be the best they can be.

<p><strong>What qualities does Clayton Utz look for in a clerk?</strong></p>

<p>The most important ingredient in our success is our people.</p>

<p>We're looking for clerks who are personable, practical, commercially-savvy, as well as flexible. Our lawyers undertake complex and innovative legal work, so it’s important that they are intelligent and motivated individuals who aren’t afraid of a challenge. We'll look at whether they've had a broad range of experiences, such as part-time employment, voluntary work, legal experience (voluntary or otherwise), or sporting, cultural or community pursuits. They need to show they have behavioural skills such as time management, initiative, goal-setting and achievement, teamwork, an understanding of client service and self-motivation.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we are looking for clerks who we'd enjoy working alongside. We want clerks who are going to be a good cultural fit and who embody the firm's values, every day, in all that they do.</p>

<p><strong>What type of work can a clerk expect to undertake?</strong></p>

<p>Over the course of the program, you’ll join legal teams and work on actual matters for our clients across a wide range of legal areas, under the supervision of a Partner or Senior Associate, and with the support of the team. You’ll have an opportunity to discover the office environment and culture at Clayton Utz first-hand, and to extend yourself and expand your knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>What other opportunities and experiences does Clayton Utz offer its clerks?</strong></p>

<p>Clayton Utz prides itself on exceptional training, and our seasonal clerks receive extensive research training and practical work experience. And because of our proud tradition of pro bono work and community involvement, seasonal clerks will have every opportunity to get involved in Pro Bono work and Community Connect initiatives.</p>

Once you have successfully completed the Graduate Development Program, you will be offered an ongoing (permanent) position with DVA. If you would like to further develop in your career after the graduate year, you are welcome to apply for short-term opportunities and promotions into other positions within DVA, and at any of the state offices around Australia.<br>
<br>
<strong>Key benefits of the program</strong><br>
<br>
DVA offers graduates a range of learning and development opportunities, both internally run and externally facilitated by the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC).<br>

Graduate supervisors at DVA are carefully selected, and possess leadership skills and required knowledge to provide you with support throughout your graduate year (and beyond).

Buddies are responsible for helping new graduates to transition into working life, navigate the Department and understand general location and work environment information.<br>
<br>
All employees of DVA, including graduates, are required to write a performance agreement and participate in regular, ongoing performance feedback with their managers. The performance feedback scheme is designed to ensure that you are staying on track and achieving your key work goals. It also gives you the opportunity to ask questions or identify new projects that you may want to work on within your placement.<br>
<br>

Generalist graduates participate in the APSC Graduate Development Program. This program includes around 14 days of face-to-face training, a major project and coaching sessions.

To successfully complete the APSC Graduate Development Program, it is a requirement for graduates to attend all components.<br>

Graduates complete 6 month rotations across 3 different practice areas, with the exception to this being Canberra, where at least 2 are completed.

<p><strong>The program provides a practical business foundation for junior lawyers. You’ll receive:</strong></p>

	<li>Meaningful work covering a wide range of practice areas</li>
	<li>Client contact and an in-depth understanding of how they operate in a commercial and regulatory environment</li>

<p>As part of the Graduate Program, we also offer a Practical Legal Training (PLT) course with the College of Law to our Australian Law Graduates, ensuring that you meet the requirements for admission to legal practice.</p>

<p>At King &amp; Wood Mallesons we adopt a holistic ""70/20/10"" learning philosophy. This means that we encourage an integrated approach to learning, where you build capability through a range of “formal” and “informal” learning experiences, ranging from day-to-day work activities, through to the more traditional face to face learning programs.</p>

<p>The program also promotes and supports the mobility of our staff across our offices by giving you the opportunity to apply to go on exchange in one of our interstate or overseas offices. Through this, you are able to access a greater choice and variety of destinations and on-the-job experience.</p>

From building relationships to addressing business challenges, you have the drive and determination to start achieving now.  The catch is most graduate programs will expose you to interesting situations and people, but will only trust you with limited responsibilities.</p>

And when we say significant responsibility, we mean it. Few organisations in Australia can match the size and variety of professional opportunities that Woolworths offers.

<p>The challenges are on a massive scale, which might seem a bit intimidating.  We are performance focused and we work hard, but we work as a team. So you will be supported by colleagues and managers who genuinely want you to succeed.</p>

Graduates complete 6 month rotations across 3 different practice areas, with the exception to this being Canberra, where at least 2 are completed. Our graduates participate in a targeted development program through a framework that cultivates valuable skills and that sets them up for success now and in the future.</p>

<p><strong>The program provides a practical business foundation for junior lawyers. You’ll receive:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Meaningful work covering a wide range of practice areas</li>
	<li>Client contact and an in-depth understanding of how they operate in a commercial and regulatory environment</li>
	<li>The opportunity to work with a range of partners, senior associates and solicitors in different practice groups</li>
	<li>A practical understanding of areas of our legal practice</li>

</ul>

<p>As part of the Graduate Program, we also offer a Practical Legal Training (PLT) course with the College of Law to our Australian Law Graduates, ensuring that you meet the requirements for admission to legal practice.</p>

<p>At King &amp; Wood Mallesons we adopt a holistic ""70/20/10"" learning philosophy. This means that we encourage an integrated approach to learning, where you build capability through a range of “formal” and “informal” learning experiences, ranging from day-to-day work activities, through to the more traditional face to face learning programs.</p>

<p>The program also promotes and supports the mobility of our staff across our offices by giving you the opportunity to apply to go on exchange in one of our interstate or overseas offices. Through this, you are able to access a greater choice and variety of destinations and on-the-job experience.</p>

We are looking for people who have an intellectual curiosity and are intrinsically motivated. Excellent marks are not necessarily a predictor of career success.</p>

,"<div class=""field-item even"" property=""content:encoded""><p>You know you’re ready for early leadership. From building relationships to addressing business challenges, you have the drive and determination to start achieving now.  The catch is most graduate programs will expose you to interesting situations and people, but will only trust you with limited responsibilities.</p>

<p><br>
At Woolworths, we believe that leadership is born from personal confidence.  That it’s your failures as well as your successes that will shape you into an effective leader.  It’s why our graduates enjoy significant and meaningful management responsibilities, along with executive guidance.</p>

<p><br>
And when we say significant responsibility, we mean it. Few organisations in Australia can match the size and variety of professional opportunities that Woolworths offers. As one of the country’s largest and most complex organisations (with 200,000 employees and market capitalisation of $50 billion), we can provide amazing leadership development experiences for you – both as a graduate and throughout your career.</p>

<p>The challenges are on a massive scale, which might seem a bit intimidating.  We are performance focused and we work hard, but we work as a team. So you will be supported by colleagues and managers who genuinely want you to succeed.</p>
